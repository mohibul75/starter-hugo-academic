***My Responsibility:***

***Responsibilities: Project Infrastructure Maintenance in Azure***

As the project's Infrastructure Specialist responsible for maintaining the Azure environment, I played a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of the infrastructure supporting the Wilhelmsen Platform 13 project. Here are my key responsibilities:

- Azure Infrastructure Management:
    - Managed and monitored all Azure resources, including virtual machines, databases, and networking components, to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.
    - Set up and maintained Azure Resource Groups, Resource Policies, and Resource Locks to organize and secure resources effectively.
- Django Backend Deployment:
    - Deployed the Django backend application in Azure Container Instances (ACI) container group to enable containerized, scalable, and isolated execution.
    - Configured container instances with appropriate resource limits, networking, and scaling options.
- CI/CD Pipeline for Backend:
    - Established a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for the backend, automating the build and packaging of Docker images.
    - Integrated Azure Container Registry (ACR) to store Docker images and version control.
    - Implemented Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline for seamless deployment of new backend versions to Azure Container Instances.
-  Vue Frontend Deployment:
    - Deployed the Vue.js frontend application using Azure App Service Static Web Apps for a serverless and scalable web hosting solution.
    - Configured custom domains, SSL certificates, and CDN integration for optimal frontend performance.
- Serverless Function and Service Bus Queue:
    - Provisioned serverless resources and functions using Azure Functions to handle specific tasks within the application.
    - Set up Service Bus Queues to enable asynchronous communication and message processing between different components.
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform:
    - Utilized Terraform to define, provision, and manage Azure resources in a repeatable and version-controlled manner.
    - Ensured infrastructure changes were applied consistently across environments using Terraform.
- CI/CD for Infrastructure:
    - Established CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure changes using tools like Azure DevOps.
    - Ensured that updates to infrastructure were tested and deployed automatically to maintain reliability.
- Monitoring and Scaling:
    - Implemented monitoring and alerting solutions in Azure to proactively identify and respond to infrastructure issues.
    - Ensured the infrastructure could scale dynamically to handle varying workloads.
- Security and Compliance:
    - Implemented security best practices, including Azure Key Vault for secrets management and Azure Security Center for threat detection.
    - Ensured compliance with industry standards and regulations relevant to the project.
- Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:
    - Maintained detailed documentation of the Azure infrastructure setup, configurations, and procedures.
    - Collaborated with the project team to share knowledge and best practices related to Azure infrastructure management.

My role was pivotal in ensuring the project's success by providing a robust, efficient, and well-maintained Azure infrastructure to support the Wilhelmsen Platform 13 application and its CI/CD pipelines.
